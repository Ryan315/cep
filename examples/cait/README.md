## Example programs of CAIT

### example_jack_o_lantern

This program is used to control the Lego-based jack-o'-lantern shown in [here](https://twitter.com/CorticTechnolo1/status/1445102625213411336). You can follow the [instructions](https://www.cortic.ca/post/build-your-own-oak-d-lite-powered-jack-o-lantern) to build and customize your own jack-o'-lantern.


For the program to work correctly, you need to follow the steps below:

1. Prepare some audio files for the program to play.
2. Place your audio files in a folder in the Raspberry OS. 
3. Change the path in the **create list from directory** block in this program into your own full path to the audio files you just prepared. 
4. If you have troubles connecting to the Robot Inventor Hub, follow the instruction on [this page](https://github.com/cortictechnology/cep/wiki/LEGO-Mindstorms-Setup).
